## Setup Instructions

**1. Cloning the repository**

1.1. Create a dirctory on your drive.  
1.2. Open anaconda prompt and navigate to the directory with the command "cd (type your directory path)".  
1.3. Launch VS code with command "code ."  
1.4. Open new terminal and use command "git clone https://github.com/SiddharthSunilPatil/house_price_advanced_regression.git
" to clone repository to existing directory.  
 
**2. Setting up the environment**  

2.1. Navigate to cloned repository with command "cd (type your repository relative path)".  
2.2. Create virtual environment with command "conda create -p venv python -y".  
2.3  Activate environment with command "conda activate venv/".  

**3. Installing dependencies**  

3.1. Use command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install dependencies.  

**4. Downloading dataset**

4.1. Download the dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques".  
4.2. Create a new folder in your cloned repository and copy and paste the downloaded data to this folder.    

**5. Training the model**  

5.1. Copy the relative paths for train and test data from step 4.2.    
5.2. In the src/components/data_ingestion.py file, paste these relative paths in line 26 and 27 as shown below.  
            train_df=pd.read_csv('relative path for train dataset').

## Business Problem

Housing price prediction is becoming an increasingly valuable tool for various stakeholders such as investors, homebuyers and government institutions, facilitating informed decision-making, risk management, and economic planning. A large number of factors influence house price negotiations and not just the number of bedrooms or total area. The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm for estimating the correct price of a house based on 80+ variables. The dataset is based on information collected from actual sales of 2919 houses in the Ames city in Iowa state.


## Project Approach

**1. Data Ingestion:** In this phase, both test and train dataset are read from csv file. Since both train set and test set contain missing values, data is first concatenated and prepared for analysis.

**2. Data Transformation:** The concatenated data is then passed through a column transformer pipeline. Based on the variable the transformer performs various preprocessing treatments such as simple imputing, nominal encoding, ordinal encoding and stadard scaling. The transformed data is then passed to the model trainer.

**3. Model Trainer:** Various models are tested to find out the best perfroming model based on Rott Mean Squred Error[RMSE] score. The best model found was Gradient Boosting Regressor. The model is then improved by hyperparameter tuning.

**4. Prediciton Pipeline:** This pipleline converts input data into a dataframe and loads pickle files for data transformation and model training and predicts final results.

**5. Deployment:** The project is deployed on amazon elastic beanstalk as a flask application to predict house prices.
